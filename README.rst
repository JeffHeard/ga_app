ga_app - App portal for geoanalytics
####################################

Introduction
============

This application contains some necessary hacks and simiar stuff for Geoanalytics as a whole.  Most 
everything here could be enabled in a specific app, but since GA consists of many modules, many
of which have common assumptions about system setup, this app exists for that.  It will also 
eventually become the portal app.  If you are running any GA apps, you should install this app, as
any or all of them may require it in the future.  As of right now, the only app that requires it is
ga_bigboard, but more will follow
